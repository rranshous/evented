We want to build up a set of code for working
with the evented api

eventedapi.org

things we want:
 Web consumer - consumer which can accept events.
                uses customizable handlers to take actions
                when events come in

 Web Producer - producer lib which takes event data and
                sends it to consumer

 Event Proxy - Consumer / Producer which consumers events
               and pushes them to other consumers
