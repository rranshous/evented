We want to build up a set of code for working
with the evented api

eventedapi.org

things we want:
 Web consumer - consumer which can accept events.
                uses customizable handlers to take actions
                when events come in

 Web Producer - producer lib which takes event data and
                sends it to consumer

 Event Proxy - Consumer / Producer which consumers events
               and pushes them to other consumers. This should
               allow users to (via web?) setup new push urls
               generic adapter which lets the proxy get events
               from multiple sources
