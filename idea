We want to build up a set of code for working
with the evented api

eventedapi.org

the goal is to create a set of libs / apps which
facilitate creating my own local event network

things we want:
 Web consumer - consumer which can accept events.
                uses customizable handlers to take actions
                when events come in. 
                Will use this to build service which sits
                on public side of event network receiving
                events from external producers.

 Web Producer - producer lib which takes event data and
                sends it to consumer. Will use this lib to
                build systems which broadcast our networks events.

 Web Bridge - Web application which can consume events and buffer
              them. clients are than able to use GET HTTP requests
              to receive the bufferred events. This will allow
              browsers to participate in the event system without
              being able to be requested to directly. This way
              browsers can be used as consumers.

 Revent Broadcaster - Application which uses revent to track events.
                      Supports registration of consumer urls, retrying
                      pushing events. Web API for managing consumers
